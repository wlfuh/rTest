# rTest
- Developing robust methods for structure-based chemical shift assignment.
- Before addressing the main goal, we will explore to what extent we can robustly assign chemical 
shifts in a test dataset to chemical shifts in reference data (which contains the test data).
We are particularly interested in exploring assignment in the presence of uncertainty (i.e., fuzzy assignment).
